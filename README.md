# Focus Pilot
## Description
This is a code for [Focus Pilot](https://maijako.github.io/focus-pilot/) - a productivity app that builds on the concept of [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to help increase focus and let user stay organized and up-to-date in activities that are important to them.

The app features a simple responsive design, different screens and interactive controls that allow the user to set a customizable timer, and add personal tasks to the list of suggested activities that display during each break time. The suggested activities encourage the user to step away from their desk. The music and the background images promote focus and productivity. The toggle-able weather and news panels keep the user up-to-date on a need-to-know basis.

    * set the length of work and break time blocks
