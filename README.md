# Focus Pilot
## Description
This is a code for [Focus Pilot](https://maijako.github.io/focus-pilot/) - a productivity app that builds on the concept of [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to help increase focus and let user stay organized and up-to-date in activities that are important to them.

The app features a simple responsive design, different screens and interactive controls that allow the user to set a customizable Pomodoro timer, add personal tasks to the list of activities that will persist through the refreshing of the page, play focus music during work blocks, and follow the built-in guided meditation activities during break times. The music and the rotating background images promote focus and productivity, and the toggle-able weather and news panels keep the user up-to-date on a need-to-know basis.

## Features
* Toggle-able side panels containing user controls and a recent news display
* Weather display tied to the user's geolocation
* A customizable timer that allows the user to:
    * set the length of work and break time blocks
    * start, pause or restart timer as needed
    * set time block transition preference from automatic to manual
    * stop and re-set the timer as needed
* A customizable 'to-do' list accessible at all times
* A playlist of focus music available on demand
* Alternating background images to match the mood of focus work
* A pop up that nudges the user towards the selectable Pomodoro breaktime activities - meditation or catching up on news
* Guided meditation options that feature a relaxing background and a simple UI
